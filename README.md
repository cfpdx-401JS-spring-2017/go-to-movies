# Lab: Go to the Movies API
## Keeley Hammond, May 17, 2017

In this lab, I:
 - Wrote a base component for the Movies API
 - Wrote two additional "child" components: MovieTable and Search
 - Removed extraneous code for CSS and JS
 - Used `key` to track iterations of values
 - Fixed the stupidly long README that `create-react-app` starts with as default (sorry David)
